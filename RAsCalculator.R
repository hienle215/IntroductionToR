###R as calculator


1 + 3
#> [1] 4
6*(5-1)
#> [1] 24

# Some useful operators:

+: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
x %% y: modulus (Remainder from division)
x %/% y: integer division
^ or **: exponentiation, e.g. 3^2 or 3**2 to compute 32
? What is the output of the following code?
  
  -1^2 = ?
  (-1)^2 = ?
  You can also try out some more complicated (fancier) computations, such as Trigonometric functions (high school nightmare):
  
  sin(): sine
cos(): cosine
tan(): tangent
exp(): Exponential with base e
log(): Logarithm
log10(): Logarithm with the base 10
sqrt(): Square root
abs(): Absolute value
round(): Round the value
floor(): Round down the value
ceiling(): Round up the value
factorial(): Factorial function
gamma(): Gamma function
digamma(): Digamma function
.
? What are the solutions to the following equations

sin(??2) = ?
cos(??) = ?
tan(??4) = ?
  ? Can you verify if the function factorial returns the correct result of 5!?

5*4*3*2*1
#> [1] 120
factorial(5)
#> [1] 120
